Not finish yet.

Project realized in the context of an internship at Strasbourg astronomical observatory.

## Adding the menu

Just put the cdsa.js and cdsa.css into your project, then, add these lines in your HTML file : <br>
-> <link href="[path to file]/cdsa.css" rel="stylesheet"> as the last element of the HTML head; <br>
-> <script type="text/javascript" src="[path to file]/cdsa.js"></script> as the last element before closing the body of the HTML;
